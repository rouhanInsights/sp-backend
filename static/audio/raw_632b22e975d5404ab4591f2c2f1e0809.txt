 A concert featuring two music maestros from different continents will celebrate 210 years of India's oldest music. Italian saxophonist, Ghernio Danito and Indian percussionist, Vikram Ghosh will perform at the central courtyard of the majestic Indian Museum on Friday. The concert is a collaboration between Indian Museum which functions under the Union Ministry of Culture and the Bonsu Foundation, a not-so-profect philanthropic organization that supports innovation, experimentation and the potential in the arts.
